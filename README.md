The South African Government has required all .za domain names should have a way to direct people to a legitimate source of information.

The relevant Government Gazette, number 43164, can now be downloaded directly from the Government Printing Works (GPW) as a PDF.</p>

The requirement for websites to link to the government Covid-19 website is contained in paragraph 5.1.4.

> All Internet sites operating within .zaDNA top level domain name must have a landing page with a visible link to www.sacoronavirus.co.za.
